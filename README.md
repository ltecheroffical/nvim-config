# Neovim Config
This is my config I use daily in my neovim setup every day.

## Installation
Just paste this into your terminal of choice:

`git clone https://github.com/ltecheroffical/nvim-config && mv nvim-config ~/.config/nvim`

## NvChad removal
The reason for this is because i'd like to have freedom in these ways:
    
    - Licensing
    - Configuration
    - Startup time

NvChad didn't give me every one of those, NvChad is still great
for a base config but i'm switching to my own
